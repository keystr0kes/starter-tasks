## Text Editor

I like to use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my text editor mainly because its fully keyboard driven text edtor. It also works from commandline so i can also use inside a ssh session. Its fast and also very customizeable. 

# Extensions

I primarily use [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for autocompletion.
