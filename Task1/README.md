## Installing Linux

I have installed Manjaro(KDE) natively on my laptop. To install Manjaro I did the following :
1. Downloaded Manjaro [iso](https://manjaro.org/downloads/official/kde).
2. Downloaded [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en)
3. Used Rufus to create a bootable
4. Restart and the select the usb device in the boot menu or change the boot priority bios setup menu.
5. After booting into Manjaro, double click the Install Manjaro icon on the desktop.
6. After selecting the language, location etc comes the partitioning. I chose manual partitioning and created three partition /boot/efi, /, swap.
7. Select the computername, username and password for the user account.
8. After clicking next the setup will start and after the completion of the setup the installer will ask to reboot.

Done! Sucessfully installed Manjaro.
